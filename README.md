# demo_documentation_swagger

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate how to document a REST API using *Swagger*.

On `master` branch there is a simple REST API written in *NodeJS* using *Express*. The API is a simple CRUD for a list of users.

On the branch `documented` there is the same API but documented using *Swagger*.

## How to run the API

Use `npm i` (or `npm ci`) to install the dependencies, then run `npm start` to start the API.
It's launched with *nodemon*, so it will automatically restart when you change the code or if it's crash.
